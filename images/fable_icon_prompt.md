# FABLE Icon - AI Image Generation Prompt

## For Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Adobe Firefly

---

### Concept Summary

FABLE is a Forth language IDE. Forth is entirely stack-based — everything is pushed and popped. The icon shows a **stack of three books** — a literal Forth stack — viewed slightly from the front so spine AND cover are visible. From top to bottom (last in, first out): **AESOP** (top, thinnest), **FABLE** (middle, thickest, most prominent), **POTTER** (bottom, foundation). All three reference literary fable traditions: Aesop's Fables, the FABLE language itself, and Beatrix Potter's animal tales. Forth's `: ;` word-definition syntax appears as subtle decoration. Stack position numbers `> 0`, `> 1`, `> 2` appear on the right as Forth stack indicators. Color palette is warm library — burgundy, gold, brown leather, candlelit atmosphere.

### Primary Prompt

A square app icon on a very dark warm near-black background with a subtle candlelight amber glow from above. The icon depicts a **stack of three hardcover books** resting on their spines, viewed slightly from the front so both spine and front cover are visible. From top to bottom: (1) **AESOP** — thinnest book, olive/tan leather binding, gold italic title on cover; (2) **FABLE** — thickest book in the middle, deep burgundy leather binding, large glowing gold italic "FABLE" title prominently on the cover with an ornate double border frame and corner flourishes, subtitle "A Forth Environment" below, the words ": FABLE ;" in monospace at the top of the cover, and "DUP DROP SWAP >" in small monospace at the bottom; (3) **POTTER** — bottom book, warm brown leather, gold italic "POTTER" on cover. All books have visible page edges on the right side with fine horizontal lines suggesting pages. Each book has ": TITLE ;" in small monospace on its cover suggesting Forth word definitions. On the far right, subtle stack position markers "> 2", "> 1", "> 0" in dim gold monospace align with each book. Warm library color palette — burgundy, gold, brown leather, amber candlelight. Dark background, cinematic, warm glow, professional app icon, 1:1 square format.

### DALL-E 3 Specific Version

```
Create a professional square app icon on a very dark near-black background with warm amber candlelight atmosphere. Design a stack of three hardcover books resting horizontally, viewed slightly from the front so covers and page edges are both visible. Stack from top to bottom: (1) AESOP - thinnest book, olive-tan leather cover, gold italic "AESOP" title; (2) FABLE - the thickest and most visually dominant book, deep burgundy red leather cover, large glowing gold italic "FABLE" as the main title with ornate double-line border frame and decorative corner flourishes, smaller text ": FABLE ;" at top and "DUP DROP SWAP >" at bottom in monospace; (3) POTTER - bottom book, warm brown leather, gold italic "POTTER" title. Each book shows page edges on its right side as fine horizontal cream lines. Subtle stack position indicators "> 2" "> 1" "> 0" in dim gold monospace appear to the right of each book. Warm library aesthetic: burgundy, gold, brown leather, amber glow. Dark, cinematic, professional icon style.

### Adobe Firefly / Generic Version

```
App icon: stack of three hardcover library books viewed from front showing covers and page edges. Top: AESOP, thin, olive-tan leather, gold title. Middle: FABLE, thickest most prominent, deep burgundy leather, large glowing gold italic FABLE title with ornate border, Forth syntax : FABLE ; decoration. Bottom: POTTER, brown leather, gold title. Stack position numbers > 0 > 1 > 2 on right in dim gold. Warm library palette, candlelit atmosphere, dark background, professional icon 1:1.
```

### Tips for Best Results

- Upload the BLAZE icon as style reference for glow quality and dark background treatment
- The FABLE book must be obviously the largest/thickest — if the AI makes all books equal size, specify *"FABLE book is at least twice as thick as the other two"*
- If the `: FABLE ;` monospace text gets ignored: *"small monospace programming text should be visible as subtle decoration on each cover"*
- The stack position numbers `> 0` `> 1` `> 2` are a key Forth nerd detail — worth emphasizing
- For warm atmosphere: *"lit as if by candlelight or a reading lamp from above-right, warm amber shadows"*
